// A store of all dialogue strings and their random weights.
// 
// Dialogue Format:
// text        - any string of characters (avoid using: {}<>[])
// number      - any string of digits
//
// sprite_id   - number
// num_choices - number
//
// dialogue    - (plain|choice)*
// plain       - { + ([L]|[R]) + sprite_id + } + text
// choice      - { + num_choices + } + ([C + , + text + ] + < + dialogue + >)*
//
// L for head sprite to be placed on the left
// R for head sprite to be placed on the right
// 
// Example:
// {[R]1}How are you today?{2}[C,Great (Happy)]<{[L]0}I'm great, thank you!>[C,Keep quiet (Rude)]<{[L]0}Keep quiet! Silence in the restaurant please.>
