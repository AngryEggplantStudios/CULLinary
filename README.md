CULLinary is a crossover game between a Dungeon Crawler and a Restaurant Management Simulator where you cook what you cull!

You are an owner of a humble restaurant in your hometown. Recently, chemical waste from the nearby factories have caused the flora and fauna to mutate into monsters.

As a result, the number of visitors to the town is declining rapidly, running your restaurant out of business. Now your job is to kill off the monsters, grow your restaurant so that you can attract visitors back to your town and make it great again!
